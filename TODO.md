#  TODO.md

1. Remove all deprecations
2. Clean up code
    - I think instead of linking all things across the process and editor class, I can just always use processor.whatever
        - After removing as much linked code as possible, I can probably move items into private spaces in both classes where they are declared public'
    - Do I need to create entire editors in the processor just to save the contents are can it be created in editor and only store strings in processor
3. Clean up README.md
4. What all can I remove from processor public entirely (can I access editor from processor?)
